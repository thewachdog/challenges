Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# What is Scanning Techniques?
# Objectives of Network Scanning
# Scanning Methodologies
# Port Scanning
# TCP/IP Handshake
# Vulnerability Scanning
# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

# Protection and Countermeasures Against Phishing

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

# Countermeasures Against Computer Virus

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.
Table of Contents
# What is Rootkit?
# Root Modes of Windows Operating System
# Types of Rootkit
# Techniques Used by Rootkits
# Countermeasures Against Rootkits

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.
Table of Contents
# What is Denial of Service (DoS)?
# Symptoms of Denial of Service Attacks
# Common DoS Attack Types

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

# Accessing the Deep Web

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.
    If your computer is connected through a webcam, disconnect it, obstruct it, or shut down that webcam.
    Use safe, private network connections to gain access to these sites.

    .onion: is a domain host suffix which designates an anonymous hidden service which can be accessed via Tor. The purpose of using such a system is to make information more difficult to detect, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.
    -.onion addresses are 16-character non-mnemonics hashes comprised of characters and numeric strings.
    Tor Browser: This protects deep web browsing users by bouncing the communication and the IP address around a distributed network? It also prevents tracking the physical location of the user. Using this Tor browser, go to google.com and search for 'Hidden Wiki' and press enter. You'll see the 1st few links. Opening those single links will lead users to a list of links that lay on the dark Web.

Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# What is Scanning Techniques?
# Objectives of Network Scanning
# Scanning Methodologies
# Port Scanning
# TCP/IP Handshake
# Vulnerability Scanning
# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

# Protection and Countermeasures Against Phishing

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

# Countermeasures Against Computer Virus

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.
Table of Contents
# What is Rootkit?
# Root Modes of Windows Operating System
# Types of Rootkit
# Techniques Used by Rootkits
# Countermeasures Against Rootkits

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# Components of a Botnet
# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.
Table of Contents
# What is Denial of Service (DoS)?
# Symptoms of Denial of Service Attacks
# Common DoS Attack Types
# Defining Distributed Denial of Service
# DDoS Attack Trend
# How to Avoid DoS and DDoS types of Attacks
# Various Factors on Which Attacker Depends

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.
    If your computer is connected through a webcam, disconnect it, obstruct it, or shut down that webcam.
    Use safe, private network connections to gain access to these sites.

    .onion: is a domain host suffix which designates an anonymous hidden service which can be accessed via Tor. The purpose of using such a system is to make information more difficult to detect, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.
    -.onion addresses are 16-character non-mnemonics hashes comprised of characters and numeric strings.
    Tor Browser: This protects deep web browsing users by bouncing the communication and the IP address around a distributed network? It also prevents tracking the physical location of the user. Using this Tor browser, go to google.com and search for 'Hidden Wiki' and press enter. You'll see the 1st few links. Opening those single links will lead users to a list of links that lay on the dark Web.

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# What is Scanning Techniques?
# Objectives of Network Scanning
# Scanning Methodologies
# Port Scanning
# TCP/IP Handshake
# Vulnerability Scanning
# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# What is Scanning Techniques?
# Objectives of Network Scanning
# Scanning Methodologies
# Port Scanning
# TCP/IP Handshake
# Vulnerability Scanning
# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

# Keep these points in mind to protect your system from hacking:

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

# Areas Where Phishing Can Be Performed
# Types of Phishing
# Protection and Countermeasures Against Phishing

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.
Table of Contents
# What is Rootkit?
# Root Modes of Windows Operating System
# Types of Rootkit
# Techniques Used by Rootkits
# Countermeasures Against Rootkits

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# Main Characteristics of Botnets
# Components of a Botnet
# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

DoS Attacks and Its Prevention

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.
Table of Contents
# What is Denial of Service (DoS)?
# Symptoms of Denial of Service Attacks
# Common DoS Attack Types

# Various Factors on Which Attacker Depends

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

# How to Access Darknet Safely
# Accessing the Deep Web

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.
    If your computer is connected through a webcam, disconnect it, obstruct it, or shut down that webcam.
    Use safe, private network connections to gain access to these sites.

    .onion: is a domain host suffix which designates an anonymous hidden service which can be accessed via Tor. The purpose of using such a system is to make information more difficult to detect, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.
    -.onion addresses are 16-character non-mnemonics hashes comprised of characters and numeric strings.
    Tor Browser: This protects deep web browsing users by bouncing the communication and the IP address around a distributed network? It also prevents tracking the physical location of the user. Using this Tor browser, go to google.com and search for 'Hidden Wiki' and press enter. You'll see the 1st few links. Opening those single links will lead users to a list of links that lay on the dark Web.

Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# What is Scanning Techniques?
# Objectives of Network Scanning
# Scanning Methodologies
# Port Scanning
# TCP/IP Handshake
# Vulnerability Scanning
# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

# Keep these points in mind to protect your system from hacking:

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

# Protection and Countermeasures Against Phishing

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.
Table of Contents
# What is Rootkit?
# Root Modes of Windows Operating System
# Types of Rootkit
# Techniques Used by Rootkits
# Countermeasures Against Rootkits

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.
Table of Contents

# Symptoms of Denial of Service Attacks
# Common DoS Attack Types

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

# Accessing the Deep Web

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.
    If your computer is connected through a webcam, disconnect it, obstruct it, or shut down that webcam.
    Use safe, private network connections to gain access to these sites.

    .onion: is a domain host suffix which designates an anonymous hidden service which can be accessed via Tor. The purpose of using such a system is to make information more difficult to detect, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.
    -.onion addresses are 16-character non-mnemonics hashes comprised of characters and numeric strings.
    Tor Browser: This protects deep web browsing users by bouncing the communication and the IP address around a distributed network? It also prevents tracking the physical location of the user. Using this Tor browser, go to google.com and search for 'Hidden Wiki' and press enter. You'll see the 1st few links. Opening those single links will lead users to a list of links that lay on the dark Web.

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# What is Scanning Techniques?
# Objectives of Network Scanning
# Scanning Methodologies
# Port Scanning
# TCP/IP Handshake
# Vulnerability Scanning
# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# Port Scanning
# TCP/IP Handshake
# Vulnerability Scanning
# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

# Keep these points in mind to protect your system from hacking:

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

# Protection and Countermeasures Against Phishing

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.

# Countermeasures Against Rootkits

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# Main Characteristics of Botnets
# Components of a Botnet
# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

DoS Attacks and Its Prevention

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

# Accessing the Deep Web

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.
    If your computer is connected through a webcam, disconnect it, obstruct it, or shut down that webcam.
    Use safe, private network connections to gain access to these sites.

    .onion: is a domain host suffix which designates an anonymous hidden service which can be accessed via Tor. The purpose of using such a system is to make information more difficult to detect, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.
    -.onion addresses are 16-character non-mnemonics hashes comprised of characters and numeric strings.
    Tor Browser: This protects deep web browsing users by bouncing the communication and the IP address around a distributed network? It also prevents tracking the physical location of the user. Using this Tor browser, go to google.com and search for 'Hidden Wiki' and press enter. You'll see the 1st few links. Opening those single links will lead users to a list of links that lay on the dark Web.

/**
Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# What is Scanning Techniques?
# Objectives of Network Scanning
# Scanning Methodologies
# Port Scanning
# TCP/IP Handshake
# Vulnerability Scanning
# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

# Keep these points in mind to protect your system from hacking:

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

# Protection and Countermeasures Against Phishing

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.
Table of Contents
# What is Rootkit?
# Root Modes of Windows Operating System
# Types of Rootkit
# Techniques Used by Rootkits
# Countermeasures Against Rootkits

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# Components of a Botnet
# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

DoS Attacks and Its Prevention

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.
Table of Contents

# Symptoms of Denial of Service Attacks
# Common DoS Attack Types

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

# How to Access Darknet Safely
# Accessing the Deep Web

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.
    If your computer is connected through a webcam, disconnect it, obstruct it, or shut down that webcam.
    Use safe, private network connections to gain access to these sites.

    .onion: is a domain host suffix which designates an anonymous hidden service which can be accessed via Tor. The purpose of using such a system is to make information more difficult to detect, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.
    -.onion addresses are 16-character non-mnemonics hashes comprised of characters and numeric strings.

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# What is Scanning Techniques?
# Objectives of Network Scanning
# Scanning Methodologies
# Port Scanning
# TCP/IP Handshake
# Vulnerability Scanning
# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks.

# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

# Keep these points in mind to protect your system from hacking:

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.

# Countermeasures Against Rootkits

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# Main Characteristics of Botnets
# Components of a Botnet
# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

DoS Attacks and Its Prevention
Darknet

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.
Table of Contents

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

# How to Access Darknet Safely
# Accessing the Deep Web

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.
    If your computer is connected through a webcam, disconnect it, obstruct it, or shut down that webcam.
    Use safe, private network connections to gain access to these sites.

    .onion: is a domain host suffix which designates an anonymous hidden service which can be accessed via Tor. The purpose of using such a system is to make information more difficult to detect, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.
    -.onion addresses are 16-character non-mnemonics hashes comprised of characters and numeric strings.
    Tor Browser: This protects deep web browsing users by bouncing the communication and the IP address around a distributed network? It also prevents tracking the physical location of the user. Using this Tor browser, go to google.com and search for 'Hidden Wiki' and press enter. You'll see the 1st few links. Opening those single links will lead users to a list of links that lay on the dark Web.

/**
Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# Port Scanning
# TCP/IP Handshake
# Vulnerability Scanning
# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

# Keep these points in mind to protect your system from hacking:

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

# Protection and Countermeasures Against Phishing

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.

# Techniques Used by Rootkits
# Countermeasures Against Rootkits

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# What is Botnet?
# Use of Botnet
# Tasks Done by Botnets
# Main Characteristics of Botnets
# Components of a Botnet
# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

DoS Attacks and Its Prevention
Darknet

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

# How to Access Darknet Safely
# Accessing the Deep Web

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.
    If your computer is connected through a webcam, disconnect it, obstruct it, or shut down that webcam.
    Use safe, private network connections to gain access to these sites.

    .onion: is a domain host suffix which designates an anonymous hidden service which can be accessed via Tor. The purpose of using such a system is to make information more difficult to detect, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.
    -.onion addresses are 16-character non-mnemonics hashes comprised of characters and numeric strings.
    Tor Browser: This protects deep web browsing users by bouncing the communication and the IP address around a distributed network? It also prevents tracking the physical location of the user. Using this Tor browser, go to google.com and search for 'Hidden Wiki' and press enter. You'll see the 1st few links. Opening those single links will lead users to a list of links that lay on the dark Web.

/**
Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# What is Scanning Techniques?
# Objectives of Network Scanning
# Scanning Methodologies
# Port Scanning
# TCP/IP Handshake
# Vulnerability Scanning
# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.
Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

# Human Precautions Against System Hacking
# Keep these points in mind to protect your system from hacking:

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

DoS Attacks and Its Prevention
Darknet

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

Darknet

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

# Why Darknet Was Originated
# Layers of Web
# Uses of Deep Web
# Ethical Uses of Darknet
# How to Access Darknet Safely
# Accessing the Deep Web

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.
    If your computer is connected through a webcam, disconnect it, obstruct it, or shut down that webcam.
    Use safe, private network connections to gain access to these sites.

    .onion: is a domain host suffix which designates an anonymous hidden service which can be accessed via Tor. The purpose of using such a system is to make information more difficult to detect, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.
    -.onion addresses are 16-character non-mnemonics hashes comprised of characters and numeric strings.
    Tor Browser: This protects deep web browsing users by bouncing the communication and the IP address around a distributed network? It also prevents tracking the physical location of the user. Using this Tor browser, go to google.com and search for 'Hidden Wiki' and press enter. You'll see the 1st few links. Opening those single links will lead users to a list of links that lay on the dark Web.

/**
Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.

# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

# Keep these points in mind to protect your system from hacking:

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.

# Countermeasures Against Rootkits

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# Main Characteristics of Botnets
# Components of a Botnet
# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

DoS Attacks and Its Prevention
Darknet

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

# How to Access Darknet Safely
# Accessing the Deep Web

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.
    If your computer is connected through a webcam, disconnect it, obstruct it, or shut down that webcam.
    Use safe, private network connections to gain access to these sites.

    .onion: is a domain host suffix which designates an anonymous hidden service which can be accessed via Tor. The purpose of using such a system is to make information more difficult to detect, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.
    -.onion addresses are 16-character non-mnemonics hashes comprised of characters and numeric strings.
    Tor Browser: This protects deep web browsing users by bouncing the communication and the IP address around a distributed network? It also prevents tracking the physical location of the user. Using this Tor browser, go to google.com and search for 'Hidden Wiki' and press enter. You'll see the 1st few links. Opening those single links will lead users to a list of links that lay on the dark Web.

/**
Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

# Human Precautions Against System Hacking
# Keep these points in mind to protect your system from hacking:

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.
Table of Contents
# What is Rootkit?
# Root Modes of Windows Operating System
# Types of Rootkit
# Techniques Used by Rootkits
# Countermeasures Against Rootkits

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

DoS Attacks and Its Prevention
Darknet

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

Darknet

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

# Uses of Deep Web
# Ethical Uses of Darknet
# How to Access Darknet Safely
# Accessing the Deep Web

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.
    If your computer is connected through a webcam, disconnect it, obstruct it, or shut down that webcam.
    Use safe, private network connections to gain access to these sites.

    .onion: is a domain host suffix which designates an anonymous hidden service which can be accessed via Tor. The purpose of using such a system is to make information more difficult to detect, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.
    -.onion addresses are 16-character non-mnemonics hashes comprised of characters and numeric strings.
    Tor Browser: This protects deep web browsing users by bouncing the communication and the IP address around a distributed network? It also prevents tracking the physical location of the user. Using this Tor browser, go to google.com and search for 'Hidden Wiki' and press enter. You'll see the 1st few links. Opening those single links will lead users to a list of links that lay on the dark Web.

/**
Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# What is Scanning Techniques?
# Objectives of Network Scanning
# Scanning Methodologies
# Port Scanning
# TCP/IP Handshake
# Vulnerability Scanning
# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.

    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

# Keep these points in mind to protect your system from hacking:

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.

# Countermeasures Against Rootkits

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# Main Characteristics of Botnets
# Components of a Botnet
# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

DoS Attacks and Its Prevention
Darknet

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.
Table of Contents

# Common DoS Attack Types

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

# Uses of Deep Web
# Ethical Uses of Darknet
# How to Access Darknet Safely
# Accessing the Deep Web

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.
    If your computer is connected through a webcam, disconnect it, obstruct it, or shut down that webcam.
    Use safe, private network connections to gain access to these sites.

    .onion: is a domain host suffix which designates an anonymous hidden service which can be accessed via Tor. The purpose of using such a system is to make information more difficult to detect, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.
    -.onion addresses are 16-character non-mnemonics hashes comprised of characters and numeric strings.
    Tor Browser: This protects deep web browsing users by bouncing the communication and the IP address around a distributed network? It also prevents tracking the physical location of the user. Using this Tor browser, go to google.com and search for 'Hidden Wiki' and press enter. You'll see the 1st few links. Opening those single links will lead users to a list of links that lay on the dark Web.

/**
Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

# Human Precautions Against System Hacking
# Keep these points in mind to protect your system from hacking:

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.
Table of Contents
# What is Rootkit?
# Root Modes of Windows Operating System
# Types of Rootkit
# Techniques Used by Rootkits
# Countermeasures Against Rootkits

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# Components of a Botnet
# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

DoS Attacks and Its Prevention

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.
Table of Contents
# What is Denial of Service (DoS)?
# Symptoms of Denial of Service Attacks
# Common DoS Attack Types

# Various Factors on Which Attacker Depends

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

# How to Access Darknet Safely
# Accessing the Deep Web

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.

Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# What is Scanning Techniques?
# Objectives of Network Scanning
# Scanning Methodologies
# Port Scanning
# TCP/IP Handshake
# Vulnerability Scanning
# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

# Protection and Countermeasures Against Phishing

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

# Countermeasures Against Computer Virus

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.
Table of Contents
# What is Rootkit?
# Root Modes of Windows Operating System
# Types of Rootkit
# Techniques Used by Rootkits
# Countermeasures Against Rootkits

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.
Table of Contents

# Common DoS Attack Types

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

# Accessing the Deep Web

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.
    If your computer is connected through a webcam, disconnect it, obstruct it, or shut down that webcam.
    Use safe, private network connections to gain access to these sites.

    .onion: is a domain host suffix which designates an anonymous hidden service which can be accessed via Tor. The purpose of using such a system is to make information more difficult to detect, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.
    -.onion addresses are 16-character non-mnemonics hashes comprised of characters and numeric strings.
    Tor Browser: This protects deep web browsing users by bouncing the communication and the IP address around a distributed network? It also prevents tracking the physical location of the user. Using this Tor browser, go to google.com and search for 'Hidden Wiki' and press enter. You'll see the 1st few links. Opening those single links will lead users to a list of links that lay on the dark Web.

Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# What is Scanning Techniques?
# Objectives of Network Scanning
# Scanning Methodologies
# Port Scanning
# TCP/IP Handshake
# Vulnerability Scanning
# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

# Protection and Countermeasures Against Phishing

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.
Table of Contents
# What is Rootkit?
# Root Modes of Windows Operating System
# Types of Rootkit
# Techniques Used by Rootkits
# Countermeasures Against Rootkits

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# Components of a Botnet
# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.
Table of Contents
# What is Denial of Service (DoS)?
# Symptoms of Denial of Service Attacks
# Common DoS Attack Types
# Defining Distributed Denial of Service
# DDoS Attack Trend

# Various Factors on Which Attacker Depends

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

Darknet

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.
    If your computer is connected through a webcam, disconnect it, obstruct it, or shut down that webcam.
    Use safe, private network connections to gain access to these sites.

    .onion: is a domain host suffix which designates an anonymous hidden service which can be accessed via Tor. The purpose of using such a system is to make information more difficult to detect, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.
    -.onion addresses are 16-character non-mnemonics hashes comprised of characters and numeric strings.
    Tor Browser: This protects deep web browsing users by bouncing the communication and the IP address around a distributed network? It also prevents tracking the physical location of the user. Using this Tor browser, go to google.com and search for 'Hidden Wiki' and press enter. You'll see the 1st few links. Opening those single links will lead users to a list of links that lay on the dark Web.

Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# What is Scanning Techniques?
# Objectives of Network Scanning
# Scanning Methodologies
# Port Scanning
# TCP/IP Handshake
# Vulnerability Scanning
# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

# Keep these points in mind to protect your system from hacking:

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

# Protection and Countermeasures Against Phishing

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.
Table of Contents
# What is Rootkit?
# Root Modes of Windows Operating System
# Types of Rootkit
# Techniques Used by Rootkits
# Countermeasures Against Rootkits

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# Main Characteristics of Botnets
# Components of a Botnet
# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.
Table of Contents
# What is Denial of Service (DoS)?
# Symptoms of Denial of Service Attacks
# Common DoS Attack Types
# Defining Distributed Denial of Service
# DDoS Attack Trend
# How to Avoid DoS and DDoS types of Attacks
# Various Factors on Which Attacker Depends

# Countermeasures and Security Against DoS/DDoS

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

Darknet

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.
    If your computer is connected through a webcam, disconnect it, obstruct it, or shut down that webcam.
    Use safe, private network connections to gain access to these sites.

    .onion: is a domain host suffix which designates an anonymous hidden service which can be accessed via Tor. The purpose of using such a system is to make information more difficult to detect, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.
    -.onion addresses are 16-character non-mnemonics hashes comprised of characters and numeric strings.
    Tor Browser: This protects deep web browsing users by bouncing the communication and the IP address around a distributed network? It also prevents tracking the physical location of the user. Using this Tor browser, go to google.com and search for 'Hidden Wiki' and press enter. You'll see the 1st few links. Opening those single links will lead users to a list of links that lay on the dark Web.

Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# What is Scanning Techniques?
# Objectives of Network Scanning
# Scanning Methodologies
# Port Scanning
# TCP/IP Handshake
# Vulnerability Scanning
# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

# Keep these points in mind to protect your system from hacking:

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

# Protection and Countermeasures Against Phishing

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.
Table of Contents

# Root Modes of Windows Operating System
# Types of Rootkit
# Techniques Used by Rootkits
# Countermeasures Against Rootkits

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# Main Characteristics of Botnets
# Components of a Botnet
# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.
Table of Contents

# Various Factors on Which Attacker Depends

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

Darknet

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

# Accessing the Deep Web

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.
    If your computer is connected through a webcam, disconnect it, obstruct it, or shut down that webcam.
    Use safe, private network connections to gain access to these sites.

    .onion: is a domain host suffix which designates an anonymous hidden service which can be accessed via Tor. The purpose of using such a system is to make information more difficult to detect, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.
    -.onion addresses are 16-character non-mnemonics hashes comprised of characters and numeric strings.
    Tor Browser: This protects deep web browsing users by bouncing the communication and the IP address around a distributed network? It also prevents tracking the physical location of the user. Using this Tor browser, go to google.com and search for 'Hidden Wiki' and press enter. You'll see the 1st few links. Opening those single links will lead users to a list of links that lay on the dark Web.

/**
Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# What is Scanning Techniques?
# Objectives of Network Scanning
# Scanning Methodologies
# Port Scanning
# TCP/IP Handshake
# Vulnerability Scanning
# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

# Human Precautions Against System Hacking
# Keep these points in mind to protect your system from hacking:

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

# Protection and Countermeasures Against Phishing

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.
Table of Contents
# What is Rootkit?
# Root Modes of Windows Operating System
# Types of Rootkit
# Techniques Used by Rootkits
# Countermeasures Against Rootkits

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# Components of a Botnet
# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

Darknet

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

# Accessing the Deep Web

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.
    If your computer is connected through a webcam, disconnect it, obstruct it, or shut down that webcam.
    Use safe, private network connections to gain access to these sites.

    .onion: is a domain host suffix which designates an anonymous hidden service which can be accessed via Tor. The purpose of using such a system is to make information more difficult to detect, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.
    -.onion addresses are 16-character non-mnemonics hashes comprised of characters and numeric strings.
    Tor Browser: This protects deep web browsing users by bouncing the communication and the IP address around a distributed network? It also prevents tracking the physical location of the user. Using this Tor browser, go to google.com and search for 'Hidden Wiki' and press enter. You'll see the 1st few links. Opening those single links will lead users to a list of links that lay on the dark Web.

/**
Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# What is Scanning Techniques?
# Objectives of Network Scanning
# Scanning Methodologies
# Port Scanning
# TCP/IP Handshake
# Vulnerability Scanning
# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

# Human Precautions Against System Hacking
# Keep these points in mind to protect your system from hacking:

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

# Protection and Countermeasures Against Phishing

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.
Table of Contents

# Root Modes of Windows Operating System
# Types of Rootkit
# Techniques Used by Rootkits
# Countermeasures Against Rootkits

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

Darknet

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

# Ethical Uses of Darknet
# How to Access Darknet Safely
# Accessing the Deep Web

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.
    If your computer is connected through a webcam, disconnect it, obstruct it, or shut down that webcam.
    Use safe, private network connections to gain access to these sites.

    .onion: is a domain host suffix which designates an anonymous hidden service which can be accessed via Tor. The purpose of using such a system is to make information more difficult to detect, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.
    -.onion addresses are 16-character non-mnemonics hashes comprised of characters and numeric strings.
    Tor Browser: This protects deep web browsing users by bouncing the communication and the IP address around a distributed network? It also prevents tracking the physical location of the user. Using this Tor browser, go to google.com and search for 'Hidden Wiki' and press enter. You'll see the 1st few links. Opening those single links will lead users to a list of links that lay on the dark Web.

/**
Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# What is Scanning Techniques?
# Objectives of Network Scanning
# Scanning Methodologies
# Port Scanning
# TCP/IP Handshake
# Vulnerability Scanning
# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

# Keep these points in mind to protect your system from hacking:

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.
Table of Contents
# What is Rootkit?
# Root Modes of Windows Operating System
# Types of Rootkit
# Techniques Used by Rootkits
# Countermeasures Against Rootkits

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

DoS Attacks and Its Prevention
Darknet

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

Darknet

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

# Why Darknet Was Originated
# Layers of Web
# Uses of Deep Web
# Ethical Uses of Darknet
# How to Access Darknet Safely
# Accessing the Deep Web

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.
    If your computer is connected through a webcam, disconnect it, obstruct it, or shut down that webcam.
    Use safe, private network connections to gain access to these sites.

    .onion: is a domain host suffix which designates an anonymous hidden service which can be accessed via Tor. The purpose of using such a system is to make information more difficult to detect, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.
    -.onion addresses are 16-character non-mnemonics hashes comprised of characters and numeric strings.
    Tor Browser: This protects deep web browsing users by bouncing the communication and the IP address around a distributed network? It also prevents tracking the physical location of the user. Using this Tor browser, go to google.com and search for 'Hidden Wiki' and press enter. You'll see the 1st few links. Opening those single links will lead users to a list of links that lay on the dark Web.

/**
Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

# Keep these points in mind to protect your system from hacking:

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# Components of a Botnet
# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

DoS Attacks and Its Prevention
Darknet

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

Darknet

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

# How to Access Darknet Safely
# Accessing the Deep Web

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.
    If your computer is connected through a webcam, disconnect it, obstruct it, or shut down that webcam.
    Use safe, private network connections to gain access to these sites.

    .onion: is a domain host suffix which designates an anonymous hidden service which can be accessed via Tor. The purpose of using such a system is to make information more difficult to detect, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.
    -.onion addresses are 16-character non-mnemonics hashes comprised of characters and numeric strings.
    Tor Browser: This protects deep web browsing users by bouncing the communication and the IP address around a distributed network? It also prevents tracking the physical location of the user. Using this Tor browser, go to google.com and search for 'Hidden Wiki' and press enter. You'll see the 1st few links. Opening those single links will lead users to a list of links that lay on the dark Web.

/**
Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

# Keep these points in mind to protect your system from hacking:

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

# Protection and Countermeasures Against Phishing

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.

# Countermeasures Against Rootkits

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# Tasks Done by Botnets
# Main Characteristics of Botnets
# Components of a Botnet
# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

DoS Attacks and Its Prevention
Darknet

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.
Table of Contents

# Symptoms of Denial of Service Attacks
# Common DoS Attack Types
# Defining Distributed Denial of Service

# Various Factors on Which Attacker Depends

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

# How to Access Darknet Safely
# Accessing the Deep Web

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.
    If your computer is connected through a webcam, disconnect it, obstruct it, or shut down that webcam.
    Use safe, private network connections to gain access to these sites.

    .onion: is a domain host suffix which designates an anonymous hidden service which can be accessed via Tor. The purpose of using such a system is to make information more difficult to detect, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.
    -.onion addresses are 16-character non-mnemonics hashes comprised of characters and numeric strings.
    Tor Browser: This protects deep web browsing users by bouncing the communication and the IP address around a distributed network? It also prevents tracking the physical location of the user. Using this Tor browser, go to google.com and search for 'Hidden Wiki' and press enter. You'll see the 1st few links. Opening those single links will lead users to a list of links that lay on the dark Web.

Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# What is Scanning Techniques?
# Objectives of Network Scanning
# Scanning Methodologies
# Port Scanning
# TCP/IP Handshake
# Vulnerability Scanning
# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

# Human Precautions Against System Hacking
# Keep these points in mind to protect your system from hacking:

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

# Areas Where Phishing Can Be Performed
# Types of Phishing
# Protection and Countermeasures Against Phishing

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.
Table of Contents

# Root Modes of Windows Operating System
# Types of Rootkit
# Techniques Used by Rootkits
# Countermeasures Against Rootkits

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# Components of a Botnet
# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

DoS Attacks and Its Prevention
Darknet

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.
Table of Contents

# Common DoS Attack Types

# Various Factors on Which Attacker Depends

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

# How to Access Darknet Safely
# Accessing the Deep Web

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.
    If your computer is connected through a webcam, disconnect it, obstruct it, or shut down that webcam.
    Use safe, private network connections to gain access to these sites.

    .onion: is a domain host suffix which designates an anonymous hidden service which can be accessed via Tor. The purpose of using such a system is to make information more difficult to detect, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.
    -.onion addresses are 16-character non-mnemonics hashes comprised of characters and numeric strings.
    Tor Browser: This protects deep web browsing users by bouncing the communication and the IP address around a distributed network? It also prevents tracking the physical location of the user. Using this Tor browser, go to google.com and search for 'Hidden Wiki' and press enter. You'll see the 1st few links. Opening those single links will lead users to a list of links that lay on the dark Web.

/**
Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# What is Scanning Techniques?
# Objectives of Network Scanning
# Scanning Methodologies
# Port Scanning
# TCP/IP Handshake
# Vulnerability Scanning
# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

# Keep these points in mind to protect your system from hacking:

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.
Table of Contents
# What is Rootkit?
# Root Modes of Windows Operating System
# Types of Rootkit
# Techniques Used by Rootkits
# Countermeasures Against Rootkits

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# Components of a Botnet
# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

DoS Attacks and Its Prevention

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.
Table of Contents
# What is Denial of Service (DoS)?
# Symptoms of Denial of Service Attacks
# Common DoS Attack Types

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

# How to Access Darknet Safely
# Accessing the Deep Web

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.

Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# What is Scanning Techniques?
# Objectives of Network Scanning
# Scanning Methodologies
# Port Scanning
# TCP/IP Handshake
# Vulnerability Scanning
# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

# Keep these points in mind to protect your system from hacking:

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

# Protection and Countermeasures Against Phishing

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.
Table of Contents
# What is Rootkit?
# Root Modes of Windows Operating System
# Types of Rootkit
# Techniques Used by Rootkits
# Countermeasures Against Rootkits

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.
Table of Contents

# Common DoS Attack Types

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

# Accessing the Deep Web

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.
    If your computer is connected through a webcam, disconnect it, obstruct it, or shut down that webcam.
    Use safe, private network connections to gain access to these sites.

    .onion: is a domain host suffix which designates an anonymous hidden service which can be accessed via Tor. The purpose of using such a system is to make information more difficult to detect, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.
    -.onion addresses are 16-character non-mnemonics hashes comprised of characters and numeric strings.
    Tor Browser: This protects deep web browsing users by bouncing the communication and the IP address around a distributed network? It also prevents tracking the physical location of the user. Using this Tor browser, go to google.com and search for 'Hidden Wiki' and press enter. You'll see the 1st few links. Opening those single links will lead users to a list of links that lay on the dark Web.

Most people believe that the term "Hacking" is used for any illegal purpose, topics related to cybercrime, or computer-related crime. But that's not true at all. "Hacking" is science and art to find solutions to a real-life problem. The term "Hack" is not directly related to Computer Science or Computer Geeks. The concept of Hacking concerning Computer Science came into the culture in the 1960s at Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT university located at Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States (US).

Hacker (related to Computer) is those people who like to tinker with software, any system, or electronic items. They also enjoy exploring how any system operates and discovering various ways to deal with - mechanically, technically, and electronically. In short, Hackers are developers who provide real-time solutions and think beyond boundaries.
In Computer Science, Hackers are classified into seven different types:

    White Hat Hackers
    Black Hat Hackers
    Script Kiddies
    Grey Hat Hackers
    Hired Hackers
    Spy Hackers
    Elite Hackers

These are people of right thinking. They are computer security experts who are experts in penetration testing and other methods to ensure that a company or organization's information is safe. These IT security professionals depend and defend the continually evolving arsenal of technology to fight against criminally-minded hackers.

These are people of wrong or criminal thinking. This term is often used for hackers who break into networks or computers or create computer viruses. Black hat hackers technologically try to outpace white hats. They usually manage to find a human error or come up with new attacking types. Hacking purists often use the word "crackers" to refer to black hat hackers. These hackers can attempt to steal money from your bank by gaining access to your computer and then fetch the password you use for online banking. They can also attempt to send spam emails using your server to the random email address for self or specific brand's promotion. These hackers can access your computer and compromise your private data, and can even sell them. A hacker is a man behind the computer who focuses on a vulnerability in your computers or networks and breaks into it.

It is a derogatory term for black hat hackers. These people don't have a strong knowledge of hacking. Instead, they use readymade tools (created or developed by other hackers) to break into a computer or a network. These hackers have very little or no knowledge about programming and perform hacking for fame, fun, and entertainment.

Grey Hat hackers have both the qualities of a White hat and Black hat hackers. They surf the internet and look for vulnerable systems in computers, networks, or phone systems. After finding the vulnerability, they hack into it, inform the system's administrator what they have done, and charge a small fee to detect and fix the vulnerability. That's why they are White Hat hackers too. But they do it all without permission from the owner of the website, computer, or network; this way, they are black hat hackers.

Controlling cyberspace and defending nations from cyber-warfare remain their prime motto. State-sponsored hackers have limitless time and funding to target civilians, corporations, and governments.

Many Corporations hire hackers to infiltrate the competition, trading, and business secrets. Those hackers may hack in from outside or gain employment to act as a mole. Spy hackers may use similar tactics as hacktivists, but their only agenda is to serve their clients' goals and get paid.
They are treated as the masters of all hackers. They have good fame and reputation among other Hackers, as we have reputed older people in our society.  Elites are senior-level hackers in hacker communities. They are known as Hacking-gurus or masters of computer hacking and deception. 
 

Gathering information is the first step where a hacker tries to get information about the target. Hackers use different sources and tools to get more information, and some of them are briefly explained here. This informations will be useful for you to become an ethical hacker.

Information Gathering is the act of gathering different kinds of information against the targeted victim or system. It is the first step or the beginning stage of Ethical Hacking, where the penetration testers or hackers (both black hat or white hat) performed this stage; this is a necessary and crucial step to be performed. The more the information gathered about the target, the more the probability to obtain relevant results. Information gathering is not just a phase of security testing; it is an art that every penetration-tester (pen-tester) and hacker should master for a better experience in penetration testing. There are various tools, techniques, and websites, including public sources such as Whois, nslookup that can help hackers gather information. This step is necessary because you may need any information (such as his pet name, best friend's name, age, or phone number to perform password guessing attack or other kinds of attacks) while performing attacks on any target.
Information gathering can be classified into three major categories:

    Footprinting
    Scanning
    Enumeration

Footprinting is the technique to collect as much information as possible about the targeted network/victim/system. It helps hackers in various ways to intrude on an organization's system. This technique also determines the security postures of the target. Footprinting can be active as well as passive. Passive footprinting/pseudonymous footprinting involves collecting data without the owner, knowing that hackers gather his/her data. In contrast, active footprints are created when personal data gets released consciously and intentionally or by the owner's direct contact.
Other than types of footprinting, some branches of footprinting a learner should know before gathering information.

    Open-Source Footprinting.
    Network-based Footprinting.
    DNS Interrogation.

This type of footprinting is the safest, holding all legal limitations, and hackers can do it without fear because it is illegal and, hence, coined the term Open-source. Examples of this type include: finding someone's email address, phone number, scanning IP through automated tools, search for his age, DOB, house address, etc. Most companies provide information about their companies on their official website without realizing that hackers can benefit from that information provided by them.

Using this footprinting category, hacktivists can retrieve information such as user name, information within a group, shared data among individuals, network services, etc.

After gathering the information needed from the different areas using various techniques, the hacker usually queries the DNS using pre-existing tools. Many freeware tools are available online to perform DNS interrogation.

Whois is a renowned Internet record listing tool to identify who owns a domain or who registers for that particular domain along with their contact details. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain registration and ownership details. Whois records have proven extraordinarily beneficial and have developed into an essential resource for maintaining the domain name registration and website ownership process's integrity.

    Harvester is also an information-gathering tool that helps you extract the email address and subdomains of a particular target. Harvester is coded using a simple python script which searches information from giant search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing, and much more.
    Metagoofil is another information gathering or footprinting tool used for extracting information or data which is publicly available on the internet belonging to the company.
    Netifera is a potent tool that gives a complete platform to gather information regarding the targeted website you want to attack. It a free tool that comes inbuilt with Backtrack Linux OS. This software will give information such as IP address, the Programming language used for website development, the number of websites hosted, DNS.

    OS Identification: involves sending illegal TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to the victim's system to identify the OS (Operating system) used by the victim on his server or computer.
    A ping sweep is a technique of establishing a range of IP addresses that map hackers to live hosts. Fping, Nmap, Zenmap, ICMPEnum, SuperScan are some of the tools used to ping a large number of IP addresses at a time; to generate lists of hosts for large subnets.

We can gather information from other sources such as social networking sites (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) where general users share their personal data and additional information related to them. Even search engines play a significant role in gathering information.

Hackers can also gather information from various financial services about a target company, such as the market value of a company's shares, company profile, competitor details, etc.

Hackers can also collect information from the email header, which includes:

    Address from which message was sent.
    Sender's email server.
    Sender's IP address.
    Date and time received by the originator's email server.
    The sender's mail server uses the authentication system.
    Sender's full name.

    Collect Network Information: such as Domain name, Internal domain names, IP addresses of the reachable systems, rogue websites/private websites within the domain, Access Control Mechanisms, protocols used, existing VPNs, analog and digital telephone numbers, authentication mechanisms, and system enumeration.
    Collect System Information: such as users and group names, system banners, routing tables, and the routing protocols it is using, SNMP information, system architecture, operating system used, remote system type, username, and passwords.
    Collect Organizations' Information: such as Employee details, organization's website, company directory, local details, address and phone numbers, comments in HTML Source code within an organization's website, security policies implemented, web server links relevant to the organization, news articles and press release.

    Classify the type of information which is needed to be kept public.
    Don't put unnecessary information into any profile, social networking account, or any web site.
    Don't keep personal contact number in any company or organization's phone book, mainly to prevent war-dialing.

    Keep internal DNS and external DNS separate.
    Restrict and disable zone transfer to authorized servers.

# What is Scanning Techniques?
# Objectives of Network Scanning
# Scanning Methodologies
# Port Scanning
# TCP/IP Handshake
# Vulnerability Scanning
# Tools and Steps Used
# Countermeasures Against Scanning

Scanning is another essential step, which is necessary, and it refers to the package of techniques and procedures used to identify hosts, ports, and various services within a network. Network scanning is one of the components of intelligence gathering and information retrieving mechanism an attacker used to create an overview scenario of the target organization (target organization: means the group of people or organization which falls in the prey of the Hacker). Vulnerability scanning is performed by pen-testers to detect the possibility of network security attacks. This technique led hackers to identify vulnerabilities such as missing patches, unnecessary services, weak authentication, or weak encryption algorithms. So a pen-tester and ethical hacker list down all such vulnerabilities found in an organization's network.
Scanning is of three types:

    Network Scanning
    Port Scanning
    Vulnerability Scanning

    To discover live hosts/computer, IP address, and open ports of the victim.
    To discover services that are running on a host computer.
    To discover the Operating System and system architecture of the target.
    To discover and deal with vulnerabilities in Live hosts.

    Hackers and Pen-testers check for Live systems.
    Check for open ports (The technique is called Port Scanning, which will be discussed below)
    Scanning beyond IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
    Banner Grabbing: is the method for obtaining information regarding the targeted system on a network and services running on its open ports. Telnet and ID Serve are the tools used mainly to perform a Banner-grabbing attack. This information may be used by intruders/hackers to portray the lists of applicable exploits.
    Scan for vulnerability
    Prepare Proxies

It is a conventional technique used by penetration testers and hackers to search for open doors from which hackers can access any organization's system. During this scan, hackers need to find out those live hosts, firewalls installed, operating systems used, different devices attached to the system, and the targeted organization's topology. Once the Hacker fetches the victim organization's IP address by scanning TCP and UDP ports, the Hacker maps this organization's network under his/her grab. Amap is a tool to perform port scanning.

Before moving to the scanning techniques, we have to understand the 3-way TCP/IP handshaking process. In computer terms, handshaking means the automated process used to set dynamic parameters of a communication channel between two entities using some protocols. Here, TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and IP (Internet Protocol) are the two protocols used for handshaking between a client and a server. Here first, the client sends a synchronization packet for establishing a connection, and the server listens to and responds with a syn/ack packet to the client. The client again responds to the server by sending an ack packet. Here SYN denotes synchronization, which is used to initialize connections between the client and the server in packets. ACK denotes acknowledgment, which is used to establish a connection between two hosts.

Scanning techniques mainly used:

    SYNScan: SYN scan or stealth doesn't complete the TCP three-way handshake technique.  A hacker sends an SYN packet to the victim, and if an SYN/ACK frame is received back, then the target would complete the connection, and the port is in a position to listen. If an RST is retrieved from the target, it is assumed that the port is closed or not activated. SYN stealth scan is advantageous because a few IDS systems log this as an attack or connection attempt.
    XMASScan: XMAS scan send a packet which contains URG (urgent), FIN (finish) and PSH (push) flags. If there is an open port, there will be no response; but the target responds with an RST/ACK packet if the port is closed. (RST=reset).
    FINScan: A FIN scan is similar to an XMAS scan except that it sends a packet with just the FIN (finish) flag and no URG or PSH flags. FIN scan receives the same response and has the same limitations as XMAS scans.
    IDLEScan: An IDLE scan uses a spoofed/hoax IP to send the SYN packet to the target by determining the port scan response and IP header sequence number. Depending on the response of the scan, the port is determined, whether open or closed.
    Inverse TCP Flag Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets with a TCP flag (FIN, URG PSH) or no flags. If there is no response, it indicates that the port is open, and RST means it is closed.
    ACK Flag Probe Scan: Here, the attacker sends TCP probe packets where an ACK flag is set to a remote device, analyzing the header information (TTL and WINDOW field). The RST packet signifies whether the port is open or closed. This scan is also used to check the target's/victim's filtering system.

It is the proactive identification of the system's vulnerabilities within a network in an automated manner to determine whether the system can be exploited or threatened. I this case, the computer should have to be connected to the internet.

If a hacker wants to perform ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) scanning, it can be done manually. The steps are:

    Open Windows OS
    Press Win+R (Run) buttons in combination
    In the Run, type- cmd
    Type the command: ping IP Address or type:  ping DomainName

Tools that can are used to scan networks and ports are:

    Nmap: extract information such as live hosts on the network, services, type of packet filters/firewalls, operating systems, and OS versions.
    Angry IP Scanner: scans for systems available in a given input range.
    Hping2/Hping3: are command-line packet crafting and network scanning tools used for TCP/IP protocols.
    Superscan: is another powerful tool developed by Mcafee, which is a TCP port scanner, also used for pinging.
    ZenMap: is another very powerful Graphical user interface (GUI) tool to detect the type of OS, OS version, ping sweep, port scanning, etc.
    Net Scan Tool Suite Pack: is a collection of different types of tools that can perform a port scan, flooding, webrippers, mass emailers; and This tool is a trial version, but paid versions are also available.
    Wireshark and Omnipeak are two powerful and famous tools that listen to network traffic and act as network analyzers.
    Names of other famous PCs tools are Advanced Port Scanner, Net Tools, MegaPing, CurrPorts, PRTG Network Monitor, SoftPerfect Network Scanner, Network Inventory Explorer, etc.
    There are various other scanners available free and inbuilt in Kali Linux OS.
    Tools and software that are used in mobiles as scanners include the names such as Umit Network Scanner, Fing, IP network Scanner, PortDroid network Analysis, Panm IP Scanner, Nessus Vulnerability Scanner, Shadow Sec Scanner, etc.

    Configure firewalls and IDS to detect and block probes.
    Use custom rules to lock down the network and block unwanted ports.
    Run port Scanning tools to determine whether the firewall accurately detects the port scanning activities.
    Security Experts should ensure the proper configuration of anti-scanners and anti-spoofing rules.
    Security experts of an organization must also ensure that the IDS, routers, and firewall firmware are updated to their latest releases.



    Hackers and malicious attackers always try to gain information by other means if they couldn't access otherwise. They continuously keep searching for information they can obtain from their victim and wreak havoc on the network's resources. Social Engineering is something different from physical security exploits (like shoulder surfing and dumpster driving). Shoulder Surfing is the direct observation technique, such as looking over victims' shoulder to get information - what he/she's typing or what password, PIN, security pattern locks the victim is entering. Dumpster diving is a form of modern salvaging of wastes such as papers, hard copy, documentation, paper-based records discarded in large commercial, residential, industrial, and construction containers. Hackers do this famous dumpster driving to search for particular information from that discarded waste.

It is an attack vector that relies mostly on human interaction and often involves tricking people. In other words, social engineering refers to the psychological manipulation of a human being into performing actions by interacting with them and then breaking into normal security postures. It's like a trick of confidence to gather information and gain unauthorized access by tricking or doing fraud.

Many social engineering attacks directly depend on people's willingness. This hacking technique has an advantage that it requires no knowledge of code. Despite its simplicity, risks connected with this attack are serious. Anyone can fall under the prey of these attacks, and everyone should keenly stay aware of anyone asking for personal or private information. This technique takes advantage of the weakest links within an organization's security defenses, i.e., people. Hence, this hacking trick is also termed "people hacking," which involves exploiting human beings ' trusting nature. Security experts recommend that IT departments and organizations frequently do penetration testing, which uses social engineering techniques, which helps administrators detect those who pose under specific types of attacks and identify which employee required additional training and security awareness against such threats. Criminals use social engineering as it's easier to perform by exploiting your natural inclination to trust that it is to discover ways to hack your system or software.

    Human-based social engineering.
    Computer-based social engineering.
    Mobile-based social engineering.

    Exploit using familiarity.
    Get a job for the targeted organization.
    Creating a hostile situation.
    Gathering and using information.
    Reading body language.

Usually, we receive an email from a friend who may contain an attachment bound with some malicious code, and when we download that attachment, the malicious code starts executing. Here, making the victim convince to download the attachment is a crucial part of social engineering. If the criminal manages to hack or socially engineer the victim's email password, then they can access that person's contact list and other compromised passwords of other social networking sites that need this hacked email's support to log in. And, because most people use the same or similar password everywhere, a hacker can put their dirty hands and log in to other sites too.

Other types of tricks used for social engineering can use a victim's trust and curiosity.

    Link-based attack: You have been given a link from your friend or someone you know, and since the link comes from a friend and you are curious, you'll trust the link provided by him/her and click it. With this single click, you may get infected by malware, or that criminally minded friend of yours can gain unauthorized access to your machine/account.
    Another similar case is what happens when there is any picture, movie, video, document, etc. which contains a malicious program bound or embedded and you trust the attachment and download it; the criminal can take over your machine and can do criminal activities from your PC or using your IP address.

Social Engineering has adverse and serious consequences, as this tactic is to coerce someone for information and lead to ill-gotten gain. The type of information social engineers can get are:

    A user or administrator password.
    Security keys and badges to get access to any building.
    Intellectual property such as source codes, design specifications, or other research-related documentation.
    Customer lists and sales prospects.
    Confidential and private information may also be the hacker's target for any organization.

If any information gets leaked, it can result in various consequences such as financial losses, degrade employee morale, decrease customer loyalty, etc.

    Human nature and trust is the base of this attack vector.
    Fear of severe losses.
    Ignoring and neglecting the intensity of social engineering makes the organization an easy target.
    Victims are asked for help, and with due moral obligation, they fall under the prey of social engineers.

    Research on target company: via dumpster driving and information from websites.
    Select the victim: identify any frustrated employee of the targeted company.
    Develop a relationship: with that selected employee.
    Exploit the relationship: using this relationship, seize all sensitive information and current technologies the target organization uses.

Attackers and hackers can also use a dial-by-name feature, which is a built-in feature for most voice mail systems to obtain information. To access this feature, hackers usually need to press 0 after calling the company's main number or after the hacker enters someone's voice mail-box. Using this phone-based social engineering technique, attackers can protect their identities by hiding where they call from. The various ways are:

    Using residential phones.
    Using business phones.
    Using VOIP servers.

Organizations can minimize security risks by:

    Establishing trusted frameworks for personnel/employees.
    Perform unannounced periodic security-framework tests.
    Use of proper waste management service to protect organizations from dumpster drivers.
    Establishing security policies and protocols.
    Training employees to defend from getting manipulated by outsiders and trained them to refuse the relationship politely or share information from strangers may be a hacker.

    Mostly, people talk about hacking from the attacking point of view and deal with logical security. Still, physical security is also a matter of concern from both malicious hackers and penetration tester's point of view. Penetration testing against physical targets is also a common phase of testing.

Physical security can be defined as the protection and concern regarding information-related assets storage devices, hard drives, computers, organizations' machines, and laptops and servers. The protection is mainly taken care of real-world threats and crimes such as unauthorized access, natural disasters like fire and flood, a human-made disaster like theft, etc. This type of security requires physical controls such as locks, protective barriers, in-penetrable walls and doors, uninterrupted power supply, and or security personnel for protecting private and sensitive data stored in servers.

Both the term has a conceptual difference. Information security generally deals with protecting information from unauthorized access, disclosure, illegal use, or modification of information, recording, copying, or destroying information. Information security is based on a logical domain, whereas physical security is based on the physical domain.

    Understand the needs for physical security.
    Identify threats to information security that are connected to physical security.
    Describe the key physical security considerations for selecting a facility site.
    Identify physical security monitoring components.
    Understand the importance of fire safety programs.
    Describe the components of fire detection and response.

Any hack may result in success, despite the security if the attacker gets access to the organization's building or data center looking for a physical security vulnerability. In small companies and organizations, this problem may be less. But other factors on which physical security vulnerabilities depend may be as follows:

    How many workplaces, buildings, or sites in the organization?
    Size of the building of the organization?
    How many employees work in the organization?
    How many entry and exit points are there in a building?
    Placement of data centers and other confidential information.

Hackers think like real masterminds and find exploits in buildings for physical unauthorized access. From the attacker's point of view, the tactics to compromise physical security are:

    Are the doors propped open? If so, that can be an attack vector.
    Check whether the gap at the bottom of critical doors allows someone to uses any device to trip a sensor inside the security room.
    Check whether it would be easy or not to open the door by breaking the lock forcefully.
    Are any doors or windows made of glass, especially the server room's doors or other confidential areas?
    Are the door ceilings with tiles that can be pushed up?
    Are power supply and protection equipment is faulty?
    Obtain network access by a hacker, and then hackers can send malicious emails as logged in users.

Physical security depends on the layer defense model like that of information security. Layers are implemented at the perimeter and moving toward an asset. These layers are:

    Deterring.
    Delaying.
    Detection.
    Assessment.
    Response.

It is a discipline that outlines how the proper design of a real scenario can mitigate crime and hacking by directly affecting human behavior. This concept was developed in the 1960s and is still used mainly to prevent social engineering. It has three main strategies, namely:

    Natural Access Control.
    Natural Surveillance.
    Territorial reinforcement.

Both physical intruders and cybercriminals have the same motive as money, social agenda, etc. Also, intruders try to seek opportunities to exploit by any means. So these three terms - motive, opportunity, and means are listed together to make a formula whose calculation is  resulted in the total risk i.e.

Physical security has the fact that security controls are often reactive. Other experts need to be involved during the design, assessment, and retrofitting stages from a security perspective. Other than that, the security measures that must be taken are:

    Strong doors and locks.
    Lights and security cameras, especially around entry and exit points.
    Windowless walls around data centers'.
    Fences (with barbed wire or razor wire).
    Closed-circuit televisions (CCTVs) or IP-based network cameras need to be used and monitored in real-time.
    An intrusion detection system must be applied to detect unauthorized entries and to alert a responsible entry.
    Know the different types of IDS systems, such as electromechanical and volumetric.
    Security personnel and guards must be used to protect data against physical theft or damage.
    The organization should serve a simple form of biometric access system (such as facial or fingerprint scanning access).
    Ties physical security with information access control such as ID card and name badge.
    Different types of lock systems must apply, such as manual locks, programmable locks (controlled by computers), electronic locks, biometric locks (facial scan and retina scans).
    Alarm and alarm systems should have to be installed in the building infrastructure to notify if an event occurs, such as fire detection, intrusion detection, theft, environmental disturbances, or interruption in services.

The term system can be anything, either a desktop, laptop or tablet, etc. When the term "System Hacking" comes into play, it usually means the art of hacking a computer using tools and techniques. 'How to hack a system or computer?' is probably one of the most frequently asked questions by most Internet users and hacking enthusiasts. So here's a brief idea of what and how system hacking plays a significant role to doom the target.

This chapter is not about motivating you for system hacks; it educates you to keep yourself safe from the system hacking.

# Keep these points in mind to protect your system from hacking:

System hacking is a vast subject that consists of hacking the different software-based technological systems such as laptops, desktops, etc. System hacking is defined as the compromise of computer systems and software to access the target computer and steal or misuse their sensitive information. Here the malicious hacker exploits the weaknesses in a computer system or network to gain unauthorized access to its data or take illegal advantage.

A hacker can hack the computer system because the hacker knows the actual work of computer systems and software inside the system. For this, a hacker has information about the systems, networking, and knowledge of other areas related to computer science. Anyone who is using a computer and is connected to the internet is susceptible to malicious hackers' threats. These online villains generally use viruses, malware, Trojans, worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, or port vulnerabilities to access any victim's system.

When your PC gets connected to the internet, the hacker may execute the malware on your PC and quietly transmits the personal, financial, and essential information without your knowing consent. These hackers can blackmail the victim for the money by stealing that sensitive information from your computer, which you don't want to reveal. After compromising the victim's system, the hacker can do these following things:

    Ruin the victim's data by deleting the files.
    Steal files and folders.
    Hijack victim's username and password.
    Steal money and credit card details while the victim is doing e-marketing or online transaction.
    Sell victim's information to third parties who may use this information for illicit purposes.
    Create traffic to shut down your website.
    Get access to the servers and manipulate the files, programs, etc.

As we all know, Linux is an Operating System (OS) assembled user the model of open-source software development and distribution and is based on Unix OS created by Linus Torvalds.

Now to hack a Linux-based computer system and get access to a password protected Linux system, we have to know Linux's basic file structure. As we know, Linux is considered to be the most secure OS to be hacked or cracked, but in the world of Hacking, nothing is 100% secured.

Hackers usually use the following techniques to hack the Windows system.

    Hack Linux using the SHADOW file.
    Another technique commonly used by hackers is to bypass the user password option in Linux.
    In another technique, the hacker detects the bug on Linux distribution and tries to take advantage of it.

The user password of Windows OS, which appears after the Windows starts logging in, lets users protect the computer from getting unauthorized access. Choosing a strong password of more than eight digits is an excellent practice. Henceforth you can protect your files and folders from the hands of malicious users. There are several tricks and techniques to crack a windows password. But, from the hacker's point of view, if you can use social engineer your victim and find a Windows computer open, you can easily modify the existing password and give a new password that will be unaware of the victim or the owner of the computer.

The following are the precautionary points you should know to protect from system hacking or computer hacking:

    Use extreme caution while entering chatrooms or dealing with chatrooms' users online.
    Continuously check for the accuracy of the personal account.
    Carefully deal with friends' requests from online social networking sites and emails.
    Don't open or click unnecessary emails from strangers or unknown senders.

    Use both way firewall and keep updating.
    Update the OS for better patches.
    Avoid questionable websites.
    Use Internet Security Antivirus and Anti-malware software protection with definition updates.
    Increase the browser security settings.
    Download the required software from trusted sites only.
    Practice using safe email protocols such as SSL, SMTPS, etc.
    Check whether the sites are HTTPS or not for better secured online services and transactions.
    Immediately delete those messages which you suspect to be spam.
    Try to use genuine software(s) and not the pirated ones because the pirated ones could be reverse-engineered. Hackers can attach monitoring or malicious tools and programs with the software.

Phishing is an attempt to grab sensitive information and identity, such as credit card details (while doing online transactions or e-marketing- indirectly money), username, and password (while using a personal email account or other social networking sites). The term Phishing sounds similar to fishing due to the use of bait to catch the victim as people for a while catching a fish.

This chapter is not about motivating you for phishing; it educates you to keep yourself safe from such attacks.

# Protection and Countermeasures Against Phishing

Auction websites, online buying sites, social networking websites, bank websites, online payment processing websites are commonly the target area of hackers to tempt unsuspected victims in a large number. This technique is carried out by instant messaging (IM), or e-mail is spoofing and often compels users (of that website(s)) to enter their username, password, PIN, other secret codes; at a fake website which looks and feels precisely similar to the legitimate website. Phishing is the logical form of social engineering attack to deceive the victim. Now think like a victim, where phishing scams will send links to you that will suppose o take you to a trusted site. It could also be an email that seems like it came from a bank and could force you to log-in to your account. As you use your username and password to sign-in, the hackers at once get your Username and password and take malicious access to your account.

To become an Ethical Hacker or Cybersecurity expert, you must know the possible techniques to perform under a Phishing attack. Let's check out some of the phishing types and sub-categories:

    Instant Messaging: is the method by which the user gets a message with a link that directs the target user to a fake phishing website that looks similar to the original website. If the user doesn't see the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), it seems hard to identify the difference between counterfeit and the original one.
    Spamming: Phishers or digital criminals performing phishing activity sends the same e-mail to millions of users requesting them to fill the personal details. These details are used by phishers to do illicit activities.
    Trojan horse as Hosts: These are invisible hacker's program which logs into user accounts to collect the victim's information; the acquired information is obtained and transferred to its creator or the phisher who sends it.
    Web-based Delivery: Also termed as 'Man in the Middle' (MITM) attack, where the attacker secretly relays and or alters the communication between two parties. Here the phisher stands between the legitimate website and the user. As the sensitive data is passed, the phisher receives that information without the user's consent or knowledge.
    Phishing using Keylogger: Key loggers are malicious programs that record every keystroke made by the computer user, which is infected by keylogger o gain fraudulent access. These keystrokes are then sent by the keylogger program directly to
    Phishing using Content Injection: Content injection is a method used by phishers to replace the part(s) of content on a trusted website's page, usually done to mislead the user to go to a page outside the legitimate webpage where the user is asked to enter personal information.
    Phishing through Search Engines: Search engines are also used for phishing scams, where users are directed to product sites offering low-cost products or services. When the user tries to buy the products by entering credit card details, then it is collected by the phisher site. For doing this type of phishing, PHP, ASP, JSP, etc. languages are used to develop this page.
    Phone-based phishing: In this technique, the phisher calls the targeted user and asks to dial a number. Here, the phisher's purpose is to get bank account information through the phone. Phone phishing is mainly done with a fake caller ID.

    Use trusted Security Software.
    Never Ever give personal information over e-mail or private messages.
    Be cautious while opening malicious links and attachments.
    Use an on-screen keyboard to type sensitive information, passwords, PIN, etc.

Almost everyone who uses computers and the Internet is familiar with the term Virus. Its abbreviation is Vital Information Resource Under Siege. Many viruses can be stopped before they get triggered if users properly maintain safety options. But there are many viruses which are unable to stop or becomes undetectable because of some technical reasons.

# Countermeasures Against Computer Virus

A computer virus is a program or a piece of code that is specifically designed to spread from computer systems to another computer and interfere with computer operation without the victim's knowledge. Hackers use these virus codes to corrupt or delete data from the victim's computer or use email to spread to other computers or networks. These viruses often get spread via email attachments or Instant Messaging (IM). Viruses can be disguised as images, audio, software, videos, or other attachments. The technique of making a disguise of these viruses and hiding them behind other files is called 'Binding'. As a hacker, you should know what binding is. Binding the Virus behind other daily usable files makes normal users unaware that they are unknowingly triggering the Virus and infecting themselves. Some viruses wreak their effects as their codes get executed. Other types of viruses stay dormant until they get a suitable digital environment for execution. Other deadly viruses stay dormant during their whole life cycle and keep sending the victim's information to its owner/creator. Even a simple virus can be dangerous as it will quickly capture the memory and bring the system to a halt. A virus that replicates itself to other computers without being attached to any files is called 'Worms'.

    Viruses travel through flash drives, CD drives, pen drives, the Internet, etc.
    Virus code gets replicate when copied by users.
    Even documents (like Word, Excel, Notepad) do carry Viruses when these files get affected.

In 1971, Bob Thomas of BNN technologies wrote a program, 'Creeper System' - a self-replicating program to test Jon von Neumann's theory, which was published as an article in 1949. Since 1987- when a virus infected ARPANET, a vast network used by the Department of Defense and many universities, many antivirus programs were developed, which periodically checks the computer system in search of viruses. Gradually the battle between viruses and antivirus came to a more prominent role, which we see nowadays.

    Boot Sector Viruses: are a special type of virus that targets the boot sector or master boot record (MBR) of the victim's hard drive or removable flash drives.
    Macro Viruses: infect those created using some programs that contain some macros within .doc, .ppt, .mdb, etc. This Virus automatically detects the macros and templates within a file, infects them in the host's computer, and hides the document or shares it through email. Examples of such types are: Melissa.A, relax, bablas, etc.
    Memory Resident Virus: fix them inside the host computer's memory and get activated every time the OS runs and infects those files that are opened for use. These viruses usually hide in RAM (Random Access Memory). Examples are meve, randex, etc.
    Browser Hijacker Virus: This Virus spread in various ways, such as via downloads. If it infects any browser in the host's computer, the browser automatically redirects the user to a particular website(s).
    Worms: are self-replicating viruses that don't attach themselves to other files and lead to adverse effects on the host's computer.
    Polymorphic Virus: These viruses encrypt themselves differently every time these viruses attack the host computer. Since they use different encryption algorithms and change their format every time they affect the victim, they become untraceable and difficult for antivirus to detect using signatures or string searches. Examples are Marburg, satan bug, etc.
    FAT (File Allocation Table) Virus: Some viruses attack the disk part's FAT location, which is used to store every information about the available disk.
    Multipartite Virus: spread and replicate in many different ways. Their actions depend on the OS installed and the presence of some particular type of files.
    Scripting Virus: Many webpages contain complex codes to create interactive UI content. Specific codes are often used to cause undesirable effects and originate from infected WebPages or browsers.
    Directory Virus: These viruses infect the host computer's directory and change the path of file location. They usually reside in the disk but affect the entire directory. An example is a dir-2 Virus.
    Overwrite Virus: Deletes information of the file they infect and left that file useless. They replace the file content, but the file-size remains the same.
    Trojan: A trojan is a malignant breed of malicious code that is sent for a particular purpose. They disguise in the target computer and do the work that is allocated/programmed by its creator. We will discuss trojan in later chapters.

Many programming languages are used primarily to develop viruses. The easiest programming languages to learn are batch programming, C, Java, Python, etc.

    Computer performance becomes slow.
    Unexplainable loss of data.
    Abnormalities will be there in computer behavior.
    Computer crashes in frequent intervals.

    Use the recommended antivirus and firewall protection.
    Buy and use anti-spyware software.
    Increase browser security setting to protect your PC from online threats and viruses.
    Update your antivirus and firewalls.
    Don't open attachments or emails from an unknown sender.

As we are familiar with computer viruses and how their code internally works, we will be going into little in-depth about what botnets and rootkits are and how they work, their types, and where hackers use these terms. First of all, we will be dealing with Rootkits.
Table of Contents
# What is Rootkit?
# Root Modes of Windows Operating System
# Types of Rootkit
# Techniques Used by Rootkits
# Countermeasures Against Rootkits

Rootkits are a collection of tools or sets of applications that allow the administrator-level access to a computer or a network. These rootkits are fed into the host computer by a cracker (malicious hacker) either by exploiting a known vulnerability of the system or cracking the password. These rootkits hide their presence using some of the operating system's low layers, which makes them almost undetectable by standard anti-malware software. So the name implies where 'rootkit' is a compound of two words 'root' and 'kit' where root describes the most privileged user on the computer, and kit describes the set of tools to implement. The rootkit has a synonym with malware, which describes malware with root capabilities.

The kernel is the primary component of an operating system. It serves as an intermediate connector between the application and the hardware. The Windows kernel has been designed with flexibility in mind. The windows OS kernel code runs in the highest privileged mode in the system, the Kernel-mode. As because all software and programs don't require system resources and hardware manipulation, a lower privileged mode also exists, knows as User-mode, where this application runs.

As in the Windows operating system, there are two modes a code can execute in: the unrestricted kernel mode and the private, restricted user mode. Rootkits can exist in both of these modes. Rootkits can be either legitimate or malicious; i.e., they may get installed as a part of the legitimate application or through some Trojans via some suspicious email attachments. There are two types of windows rootkits, which are aptly called:

    User-mode Rootkits: These rootkits function in user-mode or the low privileged level of the processor ring—the effect of these types of rootkits limits on the user level only via an affected application. If the rootkit wants to infect other applications, they'd need to do the same work in every application's memory space. They operate mostly by hijacking or hooking function calls.
    Kernel-mode Rootkits: operates on kernel-mode or highest privileged level, i.e., in the kernel space. It makes rootkits powerful as they reside in the lowest operating system level, which means its controlling capability is strong over the hardware and the operating system. Most kernel-level rootkits take advantage of hooking execution, transmitting to kernel mode, and utilizing a loadable kernel module (LKM) to enhance kernel functionalities with rootkit code. It has a subtype also - the 'bootkit,' which infects the startup programs and codes like MBR (Master Boot Record), VBR (Volume Boot Record), and effects like boot sector viruses and creates malfunction at the time of booting.

Rootkits use three different techniques that were coded in them. These are:

    Hooking: is the most common function of al rootkits, which involves hooking the application's execution flow. They re-direct the normal flow of execution and point to its code. It is internally done when the API calls and the system function calls are intercepted.
    DLL Injection: is the mechanism of loading a dynamic link library (DLL) into a running process address space. In malware and rootkits, the DLL injection attack is a malicious one with a DLL file that exports malicious functions and patches or modifies the registry key. Since these malicious DLL can be loaded easily, so it can be injected into processes of USER32.DLL.
    Kernel Object Manipulation: is considered to be the most advanced technology used by malware writers. This type of attack contains kernel structure modification, bypassing the kernel object manager to avoid access checks. Most of the kernel's data structure gets modified as the kernel is itself under the siege of this attack. Although this technique is advanced-most, it isn't very easy too. Manipulating the kernel object needs the understanding of that object in detail also.

Though some vendors exist in the market, which sells software that can detect the presence of rootkit such as Microsoft, Sysinternals, Symantec, F-secure, etc., if a rootkit is detected, the only sure way to get rid of this is to completely erase the computer's hard drive or format the operating system to reinstall it.

# Main Characteristics of Botnets
# Components of a Botnet
# Countermeasures Against Bots

The term botnet is not a malicious one. A botnet is a short form of 'robot network'. The term 'bot' is used when we have to define some automated tasks performed without user intervention. But as this term is used concerning hacking to describe a new breed of malicious threats, we will learn about it with every detail. From the cybercrime point of view, the botnet is an automated cyber army with some computers connected to the Internet without their owner's knowledge.

Computers that serve as the zombie army often fail to protect their computers using effective firewalls and other safeguards. These bots are getting created when the host computer's internet port is left open or via a small Trojan horse program that is left for future activation. The botnet controller via Trojan or other malicious programs sends a single command for all bots possible from an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) site. D-DoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack can be performed using this technique.

    Sending: They send viruses, worms, spyware, keyloggers, etc.
    Steal: They steal personal and private data from the host PC, such as credit card numbers, bank credentials, and other sensitive personal information.
    DoS (Denial of Service): They are used to launch Denial of Service attack. It attempts to make a computer or network resource unavailable to the users who are using it with a temporary interrupt or suspending of services that they provide. We will read about it in detail in the next chapter.
    Clickfrauding: is the technique used by fraudsters using bots to boost web ads by auto-clicking internet ads.
    Spam Relay: A massive volume of the span can be generated using botnets, so they are called spambots. There are many advantages to using spambots, such as:
        Spammers can hide their identity.
        The spamming source becomes untraceable.
        The spamming process can be carried out with various other tasks and with high bandwidth.

Based on the terms, the characteristics are:

    A network of infected auto controlled machines.
    They can be coordinated remotely.
    They are used for malicious purposes.

A botnet is mainly made up of two major components:

    Host Component: The bots are the infected machines that a botmaster can control remotely. The malicious program that enables a compromised machine to control the botmaster remotely is called the bot-agent. It is the host component of the botnet.
    Network Component: The botnet's network component is an online resource that a botnet utilizes. The common uses of a bot's network component are:
        Command and control channel.
        Malware distribution server.
        Drop zone.

    To secure your computer from botnet attack, install Norton anti-bots and Norton 360 antivirus.
    Configure the antivirus to get an auto-update when connected to the Internet.
    Limit the user right when you are online.
    Patch current updates of firewalls and anti-spyware.
    Ensure that your system has Microsoft Windows Update's latest patch.
    Maximize the browser's security settings.
    Verify the source of the email attachments before download or opening them.

Hackers have many reasons to break network security. Whatever the reason is, hacking causes damage both to that particular individual who becomes the prey and the computing devices and lays a more significant impact on business firms resulting in the loss of millions of dollars. A hacker also has the technique that they sat on a single computer and controls multiple computers at the same time to do a more massive hack. Though security experts have introduced advanced devices and security methods, as we all know, nothing is 100% secure. Here we'll understand how Distributed-Denial of Service (DDoS) functions and the steps required to protect the individuals and business sites and computers from this attack.
Table of Contents
# What is Denial of Service (DoS)?
# Symptoms of Denial of Service Attacks
# Common DoS Attack Types
# Defining Distributed Denial of Service
# DDoS Attack Trend

# Various Factors on Which Attacker Depends

It is an attack on the computer or network that restricts, reduces, or prevents the system from restoring accessibility to its legitimate users. It is a kind of attack in which an attacker or intruder tries to deprive system users or authorized users of accessing their computers, networks, or sites. Here the attacker focuses on the bandwidth of the victim to perform this attack.

Malicious use of resources internally within an organization may also result in a Denial of Service attack. The target computers can also be attacked from the internal network by an unsatisfied or disgruntled employee. It can also be executed against network resources, data access within an inter-networked environment. In 95% of cases, an attacker's motive using this Denial of Service is destruction and not stealing.

Denial of Service typically results in:

    Hanging the system.
    Slow response of the system.
    Slow, unusual network performance.
    Unavailability of that target website.
    Reboot or shutdown of a particular system.
    The incapability of accessing that target website.
    The drastic increase in the number of spam emails.
    Loss of Information from the target computer or site.
    Disconnection of wireless or wired internet connection.
    Damages and deletion of network resources or hardware.
    Destruction of data and programs of users that were online during the attack.

If the Denial of Service attack is performed sufficiently for a huge amount of time, on a large scale, the Internet connectivity of the entire geographical region may get compromised without the attacker even know that this thing has occurred. Thus, a Denial of Service attack compromises a system without intruding, which is enough to disorganize an organization's functionality or network infrastructure.

    Buffer Overflow: is a common type of Denial of Service attack, to send a large amount of traffic through an addressed network. The attacker may find vulnerabilities to the target system that can be exploited, or the attacker may merely make a trial to attack in case it might work.
    Bandwidth Attack: A single machine cannot withstand enough requests to overwhelm network equipment, and so a large number of packets are sent at a time to flood the victim's network or a large number of pings to a target website.
    Teardrop attack: In this type of denial of service attack exploits how the Internet Protocol (IP) requires a packet that is too large for the next router to handle be divided into fragments. This packet fragment then identifies an offset that enables the entire set of packets to get reassembled by the receiver computer. In this attack, the attacker's IP set a confusing offset value starting from the second fragment. If the receiving OS doesn't have a precaution for this attack vector, it can cause a crash system.
    Physical Infrastructure DoS: In this case, someone may nick a fiber-optic cable to the existing network hardware infrastructure. Using this attack, the traffic through the network can easily be rerouted.
    SYN attack: Here, the attacker sends many SYN packets to a target server of the victim with a fake source IP address.
    P2P attack: Using a Peer-to-peer (P2P) attack, the attacker instructs the peers or the client connected to the network to disconnect from their peer-to-peer network and connect the victim's fake website. Here, the mugger exploits the network flaws using the Direct-Connect (DC++)protocol used to share all types of files between IM (Instant Messaging) clients.

A DoS attack is reframed with the name of the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack when a multitude of hacked systems target a single system (computer, website, or network). In other words, when a Denial of Service attack is performed using several compromised devices to attack a particular system, then that distributed nature of the attack is termed as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

In a typical DDoS attack, the mugger or the attacker starts exploiting a vulnerability in one computer or system and makes it the DDoS master; DDoS master means that other vulnerable computers are detected through this computer and identified and then infected those systems with malware. Here, to launch a Distributed Denial of Service attack, in the DDoS master system, the attacker uses botnets to affect and then control many computers and then attack a single system. The attack is termed "distributed" because multiple computers are being manipulated by a hacker to execute the Denial of Service attack.

According to a report of 2014-2015, the average DDoS attack size has increased to 7.39 gigabits per second (Gbps), with a rise of 14% higher than that in 2013-2014. E-Commerce and Online advertising are affected by DDoS, with an average of 8%; the telecommunication department is affected by an avg. of 6%, public sector-15%, Financial Sector-15%, IT services, and Cloud-33%.

Unfortunately, there is no 100% successful ways to protect a victim from falling under the prey of malicious DoS/DDoS attackers. But, users can apply some prevention tactics to reduce the likelihood an attacker may use a computer to attack other computers. These prevention tactics are:

    Install Antivirus software with the latest updates.
    Install a firewall and try to configure it with the most recent updates to restrict traffic.
    Apply filtering of emails to manage unwanted traffic.

    Attack against Connectivity: In this type of attack, the attacker tries to terminate the users/hosts from connecting with another system or computer or host.
    Misuse of Internal Resources: In this attack type, the attacker tries to bind resources to a certain machine with a consequence that the consumption of network bandwidth will be large and wastage along with the non-availability of resources for others.
    Bandwidth consumption: In this mode of attack, the attacker generates many packets from the system on which the attack has been planned. This consumption of bandwidth finally leads to a slowdown of network and attack.
    Altering Configuration: In this type of attack, the attacker may try o exploit misconfigured information present on the network for DoS.

    Jolt 2.
    Targa.
    Blast 20.
    Namesy.
    Panther 2.
    Bubonic.
    Crazy Pinger.
    UDP Flood.
    FS max.

Some strategic countermeasures a security consultant can take against DoS and DDoS are:

    Aborting the attack: This protection technique requires preplanning and requires additional capacity to withstand or absorb the attack.
    Degrading Services: Identifying and stopping those noncritical services.
    Service Shut Down: Using this technique, all the services can be shut down until the attack has subsided.

These are the security postures you should apply to protect the system from DoS and DDoS:

    Install antivirus and anti-Trojan software and keep that software up to date.
    Analyze communication protocols and traffic patterns between handlers and clients to identify infected network nodes.
    Systems should be set up with limited security, which will be the honey-pots. Honey-pots will lure the attacker. The security professional can detect the attacker with the help of honey-pots as they serve to gather information about an attacker.
    Security professionals can also mitigate these attacks by Load balancing on each server in multiple server architecture.
    Set router level security and install firewalls.
    To defend against botnets, the organization can use the Cisco IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) with IP reputation Filtering, which determines whether the IP or service is a source or a threat. These IPS frequently update themselves with known threats.
    Enable IP source Guard, which is provided by Cisco devices. This feature is available in Cisco routers to filter traffic based on DHCP (Dynamic Host Control Protocol) snooping or IP source binding, terminating or preventing the bot from sending spoofed packets.

In today's world, the Internet has become the most indispensable part of human life, connecting the entire globe. But there is some mysteriously hidden internet area which many people don't familiar with. That is called the "Deep Web" or the "Darknet" that users can't usually find using regular or manual search and is stay hidden from most web surfers.

"Darknet" or "Dark Net" is a lamination of a specific type of network which can only be retrieved by appropriate software, techniques, authorization, or configurations. It is often accessed using non-standard protocols and ports.

It is also called the 'hidden web' or 'invisible web.' Here all information can't be indexed using general searching mechanisms or search engines. The term 'Search Engine' defines a program and a website that searches for documents with specific keywords or phrases and results in a list of search documents and articles where the keyword matches on the Internet. The search engine uses 'spider' - a program to fetch as many web pages as possible. The spider program of a search engine cannot find everything, and those things which are not available using the keyword search technique resides as a part of the Darknet.

Most web pages are not indexed on the Internet via search engines. Experts estimate that 75% of the entire Internet is on 'invisible Web' content. The Deep Web is the majority of online content, and it is estimated to be 400-550 times greater than the surface web. Here, most contents are not readily accessible using standard means. For example - web pages regarding private user's accounts reside in the deep Web, i.e., the private information.

It was originated in the 1970s' for security and privacy purpose isolated from ARPANET (Advanced Research Project Agency Network). Darknet user's addresses did not appear in the network list and did not ping to others' inquiries.

Characteristics of Darknet Webpages:

    Web pages with no HTML codes or HTML texts for which the spider program cannot understand.
    Web pages with secured anonymize registration form.
    Dynamically generated web pages.
    Password protected web pages.
    Web pages with real-time content.
    No further links are there on the web pages, generally called 'disconnected pages'.

There are five layers of Web starting from level-0 to level-4. These are:

    Level-0 Web:e. The common Web which maximum people use for browsing and downloading. It is accessible in any nation that does not block internet access.
    Level-1 Web: Also called the Surface Web or Clearnet - which is the reciprocal term for encrypted Darknet, which contains foreign social networking sites, Reddit, dig, Temp Email services, Web-hosting, human Intel Tasks, pirated media, free pornography, etc. This layer is blocked in some nations. One example of this level is the torrent sites, usually blocked by some ISP's, though it can be accessed using proxy servers.
    Level-2 Web: termed as Bergie Web requires one or two proxies or Tor browser to get the hidden content. It is the beginning stage of the deep Web. It contains links and access to FTP servers, Google locked results, existing honey-pots, loaded web servers, jailbait porn videos, stream videos, etc. It also contains archived web pages, web sites that don't renew their domain names, and articles. The government, business, and college research articles are also available.
    Level-3 Web: This is the next stage of Deepweb, which requires a proxy or two or Tor Browser to take access to this part of the Internet. It contains massive jailbait videos, celebrity scandals, VIP gossip, hackers and script kiddies, latest virus information and their source codes, raid information, Microsoft's Data Secure networks, and XSS worm scripting, and various other leaked information.
    Level-4 Web: This is called the chartered Dark Web, which contains hacking groups, head and bounty hunters, illegal game hunters, paid murderers and hackers, illegal trading sites, etc. Advanced covert government researches are sometimes available here but need proxies, VPNs, and Tor browsers to take malicious access to these sites and links. Most of the Internet's black market, which runs on bitcoin, is found in this Web stage.

Other than that, another Level of Web is the lowest level of Deep Web - called the Marianas Web. It is named after the Spanish technician who created it. This part of the Darknet is tough to access or browse. It is considered the safest part of the Internet because of its acute privacy. Julian Assange and other top-level Wikileaks members are believed to have access to this part of the Darknet. As a security consultant, you must know the various layers that do exist on the Internet.

    There is a large amount of information, which focuses on a precise subject.
    Holds a large amount of information that is not available on the visible Web.
    It allows users to find a specific date and time-based web pages and websites.
    Allows finding precise result or answer to a particular question.
    Improve the security and privacy rights of citizens by mass surveillance.
    Obtain whistleblowing and news leaks.
    Sale of restricted products on dark-markets.

    If users can dig deep and browse deeper, there is exciting information regarding past and present experiments and research.
    Some organizations and security researchers claim that 'Deep Web' has higher quality and in-depth articles on different topics than Surface Web. Search engines like IPL2, Duckduckgo, Infomine are used to find them.
    Ethical hackers and security researchers use these dark sites to learn about how to create viruses and information related to hacking, find a community of hackers from elite hackers to script kiddies, and learn from them via chat-rooms and discussions.

    Use Proxy servers or programs (such as Tor).
    Turn off all plug-ins before taking access to the Dark Web.
    Vertical and Split searching.
    Keep distance from links and things that seems remotely criminal or suggestive.
    If your computer is connected through a webcam, disconnect it, obstruct it, or shut down that webcam.
    Use safe, private network connections to gain access to these sites.

    .onion: is a domain host suffix which designates an anonymous hidden service which can be accessed via Tor. The purpose of using such a system is to make information more difficult to detect, whether by one another, by an intermediate network host, or by an outsider.
    -.onion addresses are 16-character non-mnemonics hashes comprised of characters and numeric strings.
    Tor Browser: This protects deep web browsing users by bouncing the communication and the IP address around a distributed network? It also prevents tracking the physical location of the user. Using this Tor browser, go to google.com and search for 'Hidden Wiki' and press enter. You'll see the 1st few links. Opening those single links will lead users to a list of links that lay on the dark Web.
